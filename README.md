--------
To fulfill the requirements for a Front End Developer role focused on a banking application, I’ll provide a basic outline for the React.js framework as it fits well with your requirements, along with snippets that reflect how you can integrate various tools, technologies, and features. This will include creating a responsive, user-friendly banking application that adheres to industry standards.

Here is a code structure and some code snippets for building out parts of the banking app's front-end:
1. Setting Up Your Environment:

Before diving into the code, make sure your environment is properly set up for React and other libraries.

Install Dependencies:

    Install React (if not already done):

npx create-react-app banking-app
cd banking-app

Install necessary libraries:

npm install react-router-dom axios styled-components @material-ui/core

Optional libraries depending on your features:

    npm install @mui/icons-material react-redux redux redux-thunk

2. Folder Structure:

Here’s a recommended folder structure for maintainability:

src/
|-- assets/                  # Images, icons, etc.
|-- components/              # Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
|-- pages/                   # Different views of the app (Home, Account, Transactions)
|-- services/                # API services (fetching data)
|-- styles/                  # Global styles
|-- utils/                   # Helper functions, constants
|-- App.js                   # Main App Component
|-- index.js                 # Entry point

3. Creating Components:
A. Navbar Component (Navigation for the app)

// components/Navbar.js
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const NavbarContainer = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: #333;
  padding: 1rem;
  color: #fff;
`;

const NavLinks = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  gap: 2rem;
`;

const Navbar = () => {
  return (
    <NavbarContainer>
      <h2>PurpleBank</h2>
      <NavLinks>
        <Link to="/" style={{ color: 'white' }}>Home</Link>
        <Link to="/account" style={{ color: 'white' }}>Account</Link>
        <Link to="/transactions" style={{ color: 'white' }}>Transactions</Link>
      </NavLinks>
    </NavbarContainer>
  );
};

export default Navbar;

B. Home Page Component (Landing Page for the banking app)

// pages/Home.js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { Button } from '@mui/material';

const HomeContainer = styled.div`
  padding: 3rem;
  text-align: center;
`;

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <HomeContainer>
      <h1>Welcome to PurpleBank</h1>
      <p>Your future of digital banking is here.</p>
      <Button variant="contained" color="primary" href="/account">Go to Your Account</Button>
    </HomeContainer>
  );
};

export default Home;

C. Account Page (Displaying user account information)

// pages/Account.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const AccountContainer = styled.div`
  padding: 2rem;
`;

const AccountBalance = styled.div`
  margin-top: 2rem;
`;

const Account = () => {
  const [accountData, setAccountData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Replace with your actual API URL
    axios.get('/api/account')
      .then(response => setAccountData(response.data))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching account data:', error));
  }, []);

  return (
    <AccountContainer>
      {accountData ? (
        <>
          <h2>{accountData.name}'s Account</h2>
          <AccountBalance>
            <h3>Balance: ${accountData.balance}</h3>
          </AccountBalance>
        </>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading account data...</p>
      )}
    </AccountContainer>
  );
};

export default Account;

D. Transaction List Component (Displaying transactions)

// components/TransactionList.js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const TransactionContainer = styled.div`
  margin-top: 2rem;
`;

const TransactionItem = styled.div`
  padding: 1rem;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
`;

const TransactionList = ({ transactions }) => {
  return (
    <TransactionContainer>
      <h3>Recent Transactions</h3>
      {transactions.map((transaction) => (
        <TransactionItem key={transaction.id}>
          <p>{transaction.date}</p>
          <p>{transaction.description}</p>
          <p>{transaction.amount > 0 ? `+${transaction.amount}` : transaction.amount}</p>
        </TransactionItem>
      ))}
    </TransactionContainer>
  );
};

export default TransactionList;

E. Transaction Page (Showing individual transactions)

// pages/Transactions.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import TransactionList from '../components/TransactionList';

const Transactions = () => {
  const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Replace with actual API endpoint for transaction data
    axios.get('/api/transactions')
      .then(response => setTransactions(response.data))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching transactions:', error));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Transaction History</h1>
      <TransactionList transactions={transactions} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Transactions;

4. Routing & Navigation:

In App.js, configure the routing and include the necessary pages.

// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Navbar from './components/Navbar';
import Home from './pages/Home';
import Account from './pages/Account';
import Transactions from './pages/Transactions';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Navbar />
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/account" component={Account} />
        <Route path="/transactions" component={Transactions} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;

5. API Integration & Backend:

Ensure you have the backend API endpoints to support features like fetching account data, transactions, etc. Here is a simple example of how to fetch data:

// services/api.js
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'https://api.purplebank.com';

export const getAccountData = () => {
  return axios.get(`${API_URL}/account`);
};

export const getTransactions = () => {
  return axios.get(`${API_URL}/transactions`);
};

You can use JWT Authentication to secure your APIs.
6. Styling:

You can use Styled Components or Material UI for styling. Here's an example using Material UI’s theming:

// App.js
import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#6a1b9a',  // Purple color for your bank's theme
    },
  },
});

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* Your App Content */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

7. Final Thoughts:

    Security & Compliance: Ensure that all sensitive user data is handled according to security regulations (e.g., encryption, secure communication, and privacy policies).
    Responsive Design: Make sure your app performs optimally across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using responsive design techniques.
    User Experience (UX): Work closely with your UX/UI designers to ensure the user experience is smooth, intuitive, and optimized for banking users.

This setup should give you a solid foundation for building a robust, responsive banking application using React.js. You can expand upon this with features like payments, advanced data management, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and more.
